	    <p>
	    Dr. Judy Hoffman is an Assistant Professor in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology 
	    where she is also affiliated with the Machine Learning Center. 
	    She completed her PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley in August 2016
	    and her postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University in 2017 and at the University of California, Berkeley in 2018. 
	    Her research lies at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning, with specialization in domain adaptation, 
	    transfer learning, adversarial robustness, and algorithmic fairness. 
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    Her research lies at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning and aims to enable learning based AI systems that can reliably benefit a diverse set of people and applications, even under resource constraints. 
	    Her research has been covered in popular news outlets like Vox, Business Insider, The Guardian, and NBC News. 
	    She has published more than 40 peer-reviewed articles and her work has been cited more than 23,000 times.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    In addition to her research, she has devoted her time to a number of outreach activities. 
	    She co-founded and continues to support Women in Computer Vision, an organization which provides mentorship and travel support
	    for female identifying students and early-career colleagues (founded 2015). The organization routinely sponsors ~40 women to travel to 
	    the premier computer vision conferences and pairs each with a senior member of the community for mentorship.
	    She served as co-President of the Women in Computer Science and 
	    Engineering at UC Berkeley where she spearheaded an undergraduate mentoring program and was given a 
	    leadership award for her efforts (2013).
	    She organized a workshop at the Grace Hopper Conference to help undergraduates in applying to graduate school (2012) and
	    served as a mentor for the <a href="https://aimsammi.org/">African Masters in Machine Intelligence</a> (2020).
	    </p>

	    <p>
	        She has been awarded numerous honors for her research and leadership. 
			She received the NSF CAREER Award (2022), 
			the ICML Test of Time Award (2024), 
			the PAMI Distinguished Young Researcher Award (2023), 
			the Google Research Scholar Award (2022), 
			the Samsung AI Researcher of the Year award in 2021, 
	        the NVIDIA female leader in computer vision award in 2020, 
	        was recognized as one of the top 100 influential scholars in machine learning (AIMiner) in 2020,
	        and the MIT EECS Rising Star award in 2015. Within the computer vision and machine learning communities
	        she has served as an Associate Editor for T-PAMI (2021-2023) and IJCV (2020-2022), Program Chair for CVPR 2023, tutorial chair for ICCV'23 and routinely serves as an Area Chair for CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR. 
	        She has organized multiple workshops and tutorials on learning with limited supervision, and has given
	        more than 70 invited talks at conferences, workshops, companies, and universities.
