    "abstract": "As transformer architectures become increasingly prevalent  in computer vision,  itis critical to understand their fairness implications.   We perform the first study of thefairness of transformers applied to computer vision and benchmark several bias miti-gation approaches from prior work.  We visualize the feature space of the transformerself-attention modules and discover that a significant portion of the bias is encoded in thequery matrix.  With this knowledge, we proposeTADeT, a targeted alignment strategyfor debiasing transformers that aims to discover and remove bias primarily from querymatrix features.  We measure performance using Balanced Accuracy and Standard Ac-curacy, and fairness using Equalized Odds and Balanced Accuracy Difference.TADeTconsistently leads to improved fairness over prior work on multiple attribute predictiontasks on the CelebA dataset, without compromising performance."
